the bruno/ folder is just a api collection
https://www.usebruno.com/


bruno is just a open source alternative to postman that i really like

to open the collection 
start up Bruno, click ' + ' and click open collection
then choose bruno/hostelMS/

and woohooo we are in


PRO tip : bruno also has a vscode extension for easier use



i am yet to make frontend/
as i have not intalled flutter yet
